Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back And let the sunlight in my lap I sang a hymn to bring me peace And then it came, a melody  It felt so sweet, it felt so strong It made me feel like I belonged And all the sadness inside me Melted away like I was free  I found what I'd been looking for in myself Found a life worth living for someone else Never thought that I could be, I could be Happy, happy  Don't go out much at all I've never been the type to call I realize to be happy Maybe I need a little company
