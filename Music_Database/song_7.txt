Yeah people, every night it's the same old thing: Getting pacified, ossified, affectionate at Mr. Flood's party, again.   And there's the militant with his store-bought soul. There's someone here who's almost a virgin, I've been told. And there's Linda glass-made who speaks of the past, who genuflects, salutes, signs the cross and stands at half mast   Yeah, they're all here: The tiny Tims and the Uncle Toms, redheads, brunettes, brownettes and the dyed haired blondes, who talk to dogs, chase broads and have hopes of being mobbed, who mislay their dreams and later claim that they were robbed.   And every night it's going to be the same old thing: Getting high, getting drunk, getting horny -- Lost, even, at Martha's Vineyard, again.
