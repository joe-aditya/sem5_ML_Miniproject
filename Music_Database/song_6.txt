I wish I drank tequila I wish I stayed up late But lately when the Sandman comes You know I just can wait No, lately I can wait And we packed up all your boxes It's all been hauled away I never stare at walls so bare 'Cause something always stays Yeah, something of you stays And I wanna shout from my guitar Come out, come out wherever you are The joke is over, open your eyes A heart like yours, it never dies And I found your keys behind your chair I still can see you sitting there This isn't funny; don't fool around You let me go, you let me down And I guess I'm still pretty angry And I don't want to be I don't know which was the bigger waste of time Missing you or wishing, instead, it was me I wish I walked on water Pulling rabbits from my sleeve Guessing cards and saving everyone I wish I still believed Oh I wish that I believed That I could also channel voices That I've endured the burning blade That I could make some of your choices
