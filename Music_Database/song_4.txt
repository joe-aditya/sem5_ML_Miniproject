Daydream Life feels like a daydream And I just wish that I could wake up I just wish that I could wake up  My mind Whispers in the nighttime Voices always keeping me up Telling me that I should give up 'Cause lately, I've been in the backseat to my own life Trying to take control, but I don't know how to  I don't wanna be sad forever I don't wanna be sad no more I don't wanna wake up and wonder What the hell am I doing this for? I don't wanna be medicated I don't wanna go through that war I don't wanna be sad, I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad anymore I don't wanna be sad forever I don't wanna go one more day I just wanna wake up and realize  Everything's gonna be okay I don't know how else to say it I don't wanna go through that war I don't wanna be sad, I don't wanna be sad I don't wanna be sad anymore I'm callin' through to the other side I'll make it through to tomorrow 'Cause that's all I can do today
