Once you left I went to space I don’t recognize this place Where are you Where are you  Now I miss the smallest things I’m not ready for this change Where are you Where are you  Can’t help but wonder  Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready now Do you forgive me am I something you can talk about I heard you’re moving on and now you got it figured out Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Are you really gonna tell me that you’re better now Hey ain’t it funny how we swore we couldn’t live without Each other now you got another got it figured out Well I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy for you Happy for you Just want to be happy too
